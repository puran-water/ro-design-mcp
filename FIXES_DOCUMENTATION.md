# RO Simulation Fixes Documentation

## Date: September 23, 2025

## Overview
This document details the fixes implemented to resolve RO simulation initialization failures and improve recovery accuracy after attempting to integrate chemical dosing and CIP systems.

## Problems Encountered

### 1. Stage 2 Initialization Failures
- **Symptom**: "Unit model fs.ro_stage2 failed to initialize" errors
- **Root Cause**: Multiple interconnected issues:
  - TDS pre-calculation for downstream stages was using incorrect values
  - Insufficient pressure safety factors for high-salinity feeds
  - Scaling factors application timing was incorrect

### 2. Recovery Accuracy Issues
- **Symptom**: Simulated recovery was 2-4% higher than target
- **Root Cause**: Fixed pump pressures with safety factors were too conservative

### 3. FBBT Constraint Violations
- **Symptom**: Complex configurations (3+ stages, recycle) failing with FBBT errors
- **Root Cause**: WaterTAP's internal interval_initializer requires properly scaled constraints

## Implemented Fixes

### Fix 1: Remove TDS Pre-calculation (ro_solver.py:472-483)
```python
# OLD CODE (REMOVED):
if i > 1:
    # Pre-calculate concentrate TDS from previous stage
    prev_stage_model = getattr(m.fs, f"ro_stage{i-1}")
    current_tds_ppm = calculate_concentrate_tds_from_stage(prev_stage_model, current_tds_ppm)

# NEW CODE:
if i > 1:
    logger.info(f"Stage {i}: Using feed TDS for pressure calculation: {current_tds_ppm:.0f} ppm")
# Keep using feed TDS - the pre-calculation was causing Stage 2 failures
```

### Fix 2: Adjusted Pressure Safety Factors (ro_solver.py:536-548)
```python
if i > 1:
    pressure_factor = 1.20  # 20% safety for downstream stages
    logger.info(f"Applying {pressure_factor:.2f}x pressure safety factor for stage {i}")
elif current_tds_ppm >= 7000:
    pressure_factor = 1.25  # 25% safety for high TDS
else:
    pressure_factor = 1.05  # 5% safety for Stage 1 normal TDS
```

### Fix 3: Scaling Factors Application Timing (ro_solver.py:572-582)
```python
# Apply scaling AFTER first pump initialization but BEFORE RO initialization
if not scaling_applied and i == 1:
    calculate_scaling_factors(m)
    scaling_applied = True
    logger.info("Applied scaling factors after pump1 initialization")
```

### Fix 4: Pump Power Minimization (ro_solver.py:906-917)
```python
if dof > 0:
    from pyomo.environ import Objective, minimize
    m.fs.minimize_pump_power = Objective(
        expr=sum(getattr(m.fs, f"pump{i}").work_mechanical[0]
                for i in range(1, n_stages + 1)),
        sense=minimize
    )
    logger.info(f"Added pump power minimization objective with {dof} degrees of freedom")
```

### Fix 5: Database Creation (ro_model_builder_v2.py:155-159)
```python
# Create database once for all ZO models
m = ConcreteModel()
m.fs = FlowsheetBlock(dynamic=False)
m.db = Database()  # Create once, use for all ZO models
```

### Fix 6: Conditional WaterParameterBlock (ro_model_builder_v2.py:616-622)
```python
if chemical_dosing:
    if not hasattr(m.fs, 'water_props'):
        m.fs.water_props = WaterParameterBlock(
            database=m.db,
            solute_list=["tds", "tss"]
        )
```

## Results

### Recovery Accuracy Improvements
| Configuration | Target | Before Fixes | After Fixes | Improvement |
|--------------|--------|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1-stage 50%  | 50.0%  | ~52-54%     | 50.25%      | 2-4% → 0.25% error |
| 2-stage 75%  | 75.0%  | ~77-79%     | 74.00%      | 2-4% → 1.0% error |
| 3-stage 85%  | 85.0%  | Failed      | 84.03%      | Now works! |

### Success Rate
- **Before fixes**: Only 1-stage configurations worked reliably
- **After fixes**: 1, 2, and 3-stage configurations work
- **Still failing**: Recycle configurations (need further debugging)

## Key Insights

1. **TDS Calculation Timing**: Pre-calculating concentrate TDS between stages was causing initialization failures. The RO model handles this internally during solving.

2. **Pressure Safety Factors**: Different stages need different safety factors:
   - Stage 1: 5% for normal TDS, 25% for high TDS
   - Stage 2+: 20% to handle concentrated feeds

3. **Scaling Application**: Must be applied after pump initialization but before RO initialization for FBBT to work correctly.

4. **Recovery Control**: Using pump power minimization instead of fixed pressures allows the solver to find the optimal pressure for target recovery.

## Remaining Issues

### Recycle Configuration Failures
- Both 1-stage and 2-stage recycle configurations fail with "infeasible" status
- Likely related to the recycle stream initialization or mass balance
- Needs further investigation

## Next Steps

1. **Debug Recycle Failures**: Investigate why recycle configurations are infeasible
2. **Complete Chemical Dosing Integration**: Continue with phases 2-5 of the original plan
3. **Add CIP System**: Integrate CIP sizing based on largest stage
4. **Validate with More Test Cases**: Test with different salinities and recovery targets

## Latest Fixes (Continuation Session)

### Fix 7: Recovery Constraint for Recycle Systems
**File**: `utils/ro_solver.py` (Lines 1110-1139)
**Problem**: System achieving 89.8% recovery when 70% requested
**Solution**: Added system-level recovery constraint for recycle configurations
```python
# System recovery = (fresh_feed - disposal) / fresh_feed
m.fs.system_recovery_constraint = Constraint(
    expr=(fresh_h2o - disposal_h2o) / fresh_h2o >= target_recovery - recovery_tolerance
)
```

### Fix 8: Pump Power Calculation Error (18x)
**File**: `utils/ro_initialization.py` (Line 253)
**Problem**: Pump power underreported by factor of 18
**Solution**: Fixed unit conversion - removed double multiplication by pyunits.Pa
```python
# OLD: pump.outlet.pressure[0].fix(required_pressure * pyunits.Pa)
# NEW: pump.outlet.pressure[0].fix(required_pressure)  # Already in Pa
```

### Fix 9: Membrane Name Normalization
**File**: `utils/membrane_properties_handler.py` (Lines 19-54, 236-250)
**Problem**: SW30HRLE_440 (underscore) vs SW30HRLE-440 (hyphen) mismatch
**Solution**: Added normalize_membrane_name() function to handle naming variations
```python
def normalize_membrane_name(membrane_model: str) -> str:
    # Converts SW30HRLE_440 → SW30HRLE-440
    if 'SW30' in membrane_model and '_' in membrane_model:
        normalized = re.sub(r'_(\d)', r'-\1', membrane_model)
```

### Fix 10: Chemical Dosing AMPL Errors
**File**: `utils/ro_model_builder_v2.py` (Lines 644-646)
**Problem**: Chemical dosing ZO models cause AMPL evaluation errors in subprocess
**Solution**: Temporarily disabled chemical dosing to allow MCP server to work
```python
if chemical_dosing:
    logger.warning("SKIPPING chemical dosing due to AMPL errors in ZO models")
    # TODO: Fix ZO model AMPL errors
```
