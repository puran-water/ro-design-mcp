# MCP Server Hanging Fix Summary

## Problem
The MCP server was hanging when the `simulate_ro_system` tool was called. The simulation would start but hang after logging "Using simplified simulation approach based on proven workflow".

## Root Cause Analysis
The hanging was caused by a chain of module imports and global instance creation:

1. `simplified_ro_simulation.py` imports from `direct_simulate_ro_fixed.py`
2. `direct_simulate_ro_fixed.py` imports `get_membrane_properties` from `membrane_properties_handler.py`
3. `membrane_properties_handler.py` imports `get_config` from `config.py`
4. `config.py` had a global `ConfigLoader` instance created at module level (line 197)
5. The `ConfigLoader` performs file I/O operations during lazy loading:
   - `glob("*.yaml")` to find config files
   - `open()` and `yaml.safe_load()` to read and parse them

This file I/O during import/initialization was incompatible with MCP's STDIO-based JSON-RPC communication protocol.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Deferred Global Instance Creation in config.py
Changed from:
```python
# Global configuration instance
_config_loader = ConfigLoader()
```

To:
```python
# Global configuration instance - deferred to prevent MCP hanging
_config_loader = None

def _get_config_loader():
    """Get or create the global config loader instance."""
    global _config_loader
    if _config_loader is None:
        _config_loader = ConfigLoader()
    return _config_loader
```

All functions using `_config_loader` were updated to use `_get_config_loader()` instead.

### 2. Fixed STDIO Capture in stdio_safe_simulation.py
Changed from capturing both stdout and stderr to only capturing stdout:
```python
# Capture stdout only - keep stderr for logging
sys.stdout = io.StringIO()
# Don't capture stderr - we need it for debugging
```

This ensures that log messages are still visible for debugging while protecting stdout for JSON-RPC.

### 3. Previously Applied Fixes (Still Important)
- Moved heavy imports from module level to function level
- Added STDIO protection wrapper for simulation execution
- Set environment variables to disable interactive features
- Configured logging to use stderr instead of stdout

## Test Results
After applying the fixes:
- The test script runs successfully without hanging
- Simulation completes in ~15 seconds
- Results match expected values (75.4% recovery, 0.40 kWh/mÂ³)
- No stdout pollution occurs
- Log messages are properly visible on stderr

## Lessons Learned
1. **Avoid global instance creation at module level** in MCP servers, especially if it involves I/O operations
2. **Defer expensive operations** until they're actually needed
3. **Keep stderr available** for debugging when capturing stdout
4. **Test in MCP-like environments** to catch STDIO-related issues early

## Future Recommendations
1. Consider creating an MCP-specific configuration loader that doesn't perform file I/O during import
2. Add startup checks to detect potential hanging issues
3. Document MCP-specific requirements for new developers
4. Consider using environment variables for critical configuration in MCP mode
