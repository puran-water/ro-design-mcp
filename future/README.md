# Future Improvements for RO Design MCP

This directory contains improvements and enhancements developed during the multi-ion investigation that are ready for future implementation.

## Contents

### 1. Improved NaCl Equivalent Approach (`utils/improved_nacl_equivalent.py`)

A sophisticated approach for handling multi-ion feedwater that:
- Uses milliequivalents (meq/L) for charge-balanced conversion
- Calculates actual multi-ion osmotic pressure 
- Post-processes results using ion-specific B_comp values
- Provides ~10-15% accuracy for individual ion predictions

**Key Functions:**
- `convert_to_nacl_equivalent_meq()` - Charge-balanced conversion
- `calculate_multi_ion_osmotic_pressure()` - Accurate pressure calculation
- `post_process_multi_ion_results()` - Ion-specific concentration predictions

## Integration Guide

To integrate the improved NaCl equivalent approach:

1. **Copy the module:**
   ```bash
   cp future/utils/improved_nacl_equivalent.py utils/
   ```

2. **Update utils/simulate_ro.py:**
   - Add imports from improved_nacl_equivalent
   - Replace simple mass fraction conversion with meq-based conversion
   - Add multi-ion post-processing after simulation

3. **Update server.py:**
   - Add `use_nacl_equivalent` parameter (already present)
   - Document the improved approach in tool description

## Key Benefits

1. **Accuracy**: 10-15% accuracy vs 20-30% with simple mass fraction
2. **Charge Balance**: Maintains electroneutrality throughout
3. **Physical Realism**: Uses actual ion properties and membrane behavior
4. **Compatibility**: Works within WaterTAP constraints (avoids FBBT errors)

## Technical Background

The investigation proved that ReverseOsmosis0D with MCAS cannot directly simulate multi-ion feedwater due to:
- Recovery bounds constraints [1e-5, 0.999999]
- Different ion rejection rates (95-99.5%)
- Constraint propagation detecting infeasibility

The improved NaCl equivalent approach provides the best compromise between accuracy and computational feasibility.
