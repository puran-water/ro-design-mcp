# RO Simulation Test Results Analysis

## Test Results Summary

| Feed Salinity (ppm) | System Recovery (%) | Permeate TDS (mg/L) | Specific Energy (kWh/m³) | Status |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|--------|
| 2,000 (Low Brackish) | 16.8 | 11 | 2,066.50 | ❌ Energy too high |
| 5,000 (Med Brackish) | 17.8 | 26 | 1,958.19 | ❌ Energy too high |
| 10,000 (High Brackish) | 19.2 | 49 | 1,817.82 | ❌ Energy too high |
| 35,000 (Seawater) | 21.5 | 141 | 1,641.45 | ❌ Energy too high |

## Industry Benchmarks for Comparison

| Water Type | Typical Recovery (%) | Typical Energy (kWh/m³) | Expected Permeate TDS (mg/L) |
|------------|---------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------|
| Low Brackish (1-3k ppm) | 75-85 | 0.5-1.0 | <500 |
| Med Brackish (3-10k ppm) | 60-75 | 1.0-2.0 | <500 |
| High Brackish (10-15k ppm) | 50-60 | 1.5-2.5 | <500 |
| Seawater (30-40k ppm) | 40-50 | 2.5-4.0 | <500 |

## Issues Identified

### 1. **Extremely High Specific Energy**
- Brackish water showing 1,800-2,000+ kWh/m³ (should be 0.5-2.5)
- Seawater showing 1,641 kWh/m³ (should be 2.5-4.0)
- **Factor of ~1000x too high!**

### 2. **Very Low Recovery Rates**
- All recoveries are 16-21% (should be 40-85% depending on salinity)
- Stage recoveries might be set too low in config

### 3. **Excellent Salt Rejection**
- Permeate quality is good (11-141 mg/L)
- This suggests membrane properties are reasonable

## Likely Root Causes

1. **Unit Conversion Error in Energy Calculation**
   - Possibly reporting kWh/L instead of kWh/m³
   - Or J/m³ being reported as kWh/m³

2. **Recovery Configuration Issue**
   - Stage recoveries of 50% and 40% are being achieved as ~9-13% actual
   - Possible issue with recovery calculation or pump pressure optimization

3. **Flow Rate Basis**
   - Energy might be calculated on feed flow instead of permeate flow
   - With ~20% recovery, this would inflate energy by 5x (still not enough to explain 1000x)

## Recommended Checks

1. Check energy calculation in `ro_results_extractor.py`:
   - Verify unit conversions (W to kW, m³/h to m³/s)
   - Ensure energy is divided by permeate flow, not feed flow

2. Check pump work calculation:
   - Verify pump work units (should be in W or kW)
   - Check if pump efficiency is being applied correctly

3. Verify recovery calculation:
   - Check if recovery is calculated correctly (permeate/feed flows)
   - Investigate why target recoveries aren't being achieved
