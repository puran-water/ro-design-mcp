## Key Performance Indicators Comparison

| Metric | Test 1 (Brackish) | Test 2 (Seawater) | Industry Typical |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **LCOW ($/m³)** | 0.178 | 0.863 | 0.15-0.30 (brackish), 0.50-1.50 (seawater) |
| **Specific Energy (kWh/m³)** | ~1.0 | 5.45 | 0.8-1.5 (brackish), 2-3 (seawater w/ERD) |
| **Recovery (%)** | 75.3 | 51.5 | 70-85 (brackish), 45-55 (seawater) |
| **Permeate TDS (mg/L)** | ~10 | ~300 | <500 (potable) |
| **Capital Intensity ($/m³/h)** | 3,540 | 5,035 | 2,000-5,000 (brackish), 4,000-8,000 (seawater) |

## Notes

1. **Energy Consumption**: Seawater Test 2 shows 5.45 kWh/m³ because the ERD is not properly integrated into the feed flow path. With proper integration (split/mix configuration), this should reduce to 2-3 kWh/m³.

2. **ERD Implementation**: Currently uses a simplified dummy feed approach. The ERD hydraulic power recovery (~30 kW) is tracked but doesn't reduce pump duty.

3. **Capital Costs**: Include membrane vessels, pumps, ERD (Test 2), CIP system, and cartridge filters where applicable.

4. **Operating Costs**: Include electricity, membrane replacement (20%/year), chemicals (antiscalant, CIP), and maintenance.

5. **Model Limitations**: 
   - Cartridge filter unit cannot be modeled with MCAS property package (cost included manually)
   - ERD requires flowsheet rewiring for realistic energy reduction
   - Some ancillary equipment costs are estimated

6. **Validation**: All values are within expected industry ranges except for seawater specific energy, which is higher due to ERD integration limitations.
