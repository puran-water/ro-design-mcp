### Key Observations

1. **Energy Recovery Device (ERD):**
   - Seawater system includes $53,500 ERD but energy benefit not fully realized
   - With proper ERD integration, seawater energy could drop to ~3 kWh/m³

2. **Membrane Costs:**
   - Brackish: $265,322 (74% of CAPEX)
   - Seawater: $156,072 (64% of CAPEX)
   - Seawater membranes 2.5× more expensive per m²

3. **Operating Pressure:**
   - Brackish operates at 13-22 bar (manageable with standard materials)
   - Seawater requires 86 bar (requires duplex stainless steel)

4. **Chemical Usage:**
   - Both systems use 5 mg/L antiscalant
   - No pH adjustment required for either system
   - CIP systems not included but would add ~$50/m² capital

5. **Ion Rejection Performance:**
   - Divalent ions (Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, SO₄²⁻) show higher rejection
   - Monovalent ions (Na⁺, Cl⁻) follow membrane specifications
   - Trace elements (Sr²⁺, Ba²⁺) achieve >99% rejection
   - Weak acids (F⁻, Br⁻) show lower rejection (~95%)
