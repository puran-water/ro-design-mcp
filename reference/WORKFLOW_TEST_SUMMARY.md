# Configuration to Simulation Workflow Test Summary

## Date: 2025-07-17

## Test Overview
Testing the complete workflow from configuration tool to simulation for multiple membrane types at 150 m³/h flow and 75% recovery target.

## Key Findings

### 1. Configuration Tool Success
The configuration tool successfully sized membrane areas for all three membrane types:
- **BW30-400**: 6503 m² total area (57.8 m²/(m³/h) specific area)
- **ECO PRO-400**: 6503 m² total area (57.8 m²/(m³/h) specific area)  
- **CR100 PRO-400**: 6503 m² total area (57.8 m²/(m³/h) specific area)

All configurations used 2-stage designs with:
- Stage 1: 55.8% recovery, 4422 m² area, 18.9 LMH flux
- Stage 2: 44.4% recovery, 2081 m² area, 14.1 LMH flux

### 2. Simulation Issues
The simulation phase encountered initialization failures:
- **Root Cause**: Component indexing mismatch in WaterTAP templates
- **Specific Error**: A_comp indexing uses `(0.0, 'H2O')` not `(0, 'Liq', 'H2O')`

### 3. Key Technical Insights

#### Flux and Recovery Relationship
- When membrane area is properly sized by the configuration tool, flux and recovery are NOT independent
- The configuration tool calculates required area based on reasonable flux targets (15-20 LMH)
- High-permeability membranes (ECO PRO-400) can achieve 75% recovery when sufficient area is provided

#### TDS-Aware Pressure Calculations
Enhanced stage pressure calculations were implemented that consider:
1. Membrane permeability (A_w)
2. Inlet TDS and osmotic pressure progression
3. Target recovery per stage
4. Flux limits (max 0.025 kg/m²/s for safety margin)

Example for ECO PRO-400 (A_w = 1.60e-11 m/s/Pa):
- Stage 1 (5000 ppm inlet): Max pressure 19.6 bar
- Stage 2 (10000 ppm inlet): Max pressure would be higher but limited by flux

## Implementation Status

### Completed
1. ✓ Enhanced stage pressure calculation function
2. ✓ StageConditions tracking class  
3. ✓ Updated initialization functions with TDS-aware pressure logic
4. ✓ Fixed component indexing in templates (A_comp[0.0, 'H2O'])
5. ✓ Tested configuration tool for all membrane types

### Pending
1. Update all simulation templates to use enhanced pressure calculations
2. Create comprehensive documentation for enhanced initialization
3. Complete end-to-end testing after template updates

## Code Changes

### 1. stage_pressure_calculation.py
New module with StageConditions dataclass and calculate_stage_pressure_with_flux_limit() function

### 2. ro_initialization.py
- Added initialize_multistage_ro_enhanced() function
- Fixed A_comp indexing from `(time, 'Liq', 'H2O')` to `(time, 'H2O')` for seawater package

### 3. Notebook Templates
- Fixed A_comp indexing to use 0.0 instead of 0 for time index
- Updated to use correct component indices for SD transport model

## Recommendations

1. **Template Consolidation**: Consider consolidating the multiple simulation templates into a single flexible template
2. **Caching Issues**: Papermill may cache executed notebooks - consider clearing temp files between runs
3. **Flux Validation**: Add explicit flux checks before attempting initialization
4. **Error Handling**: Improve error messages to clearly indicate indexing issues

## Conclusion

The configuration tool successfully handles high-permeability membranes by appropriately sizing membrane area. The key insight is that flux and recovery are coupled through area - the configuration tool ensures reasonable flux by calculating sufficient area for the target recovery. With proper initialization that respects flux bounds and TDS progression, all membrane types should successfully simulate at 75% recovery.
