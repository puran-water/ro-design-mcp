# Pump Costing Fix Documentation

## Issue Summary

The RO MCP server was incorrectly classifying all pumps as "high_pressure" by default, resulting in excessive cost estimates. WaterTAP's pump costing defaults to high_pressure when pump_type is not explicitly specified.

## Root Cause

In `utils/ro_model_builder.py`, pumps were created without specifying the `pump_type` parameter:

```python
# Previous code (incorrect)
pump.costing = UnitModelCostingBlock(
    flowsheet_costing_block=m.fs.costing
)
```

## Solution Implemented

Added pump type classification logic based on operating pressure:

```python
# Fixed code
if feed_pressure_bar < 45:
    pump_type = "low_pressure"
else:
    pump_type = "high_pressure"

pump.costing = UnitModelCostingBlock(
    flowsheet_costing_block=m.fs.costing,
    costing_method=cost_pump,
    costing_method_arguments={"pump_type": pump_type}
)
```

## Pressure Classification

- **Low Pressure**: < 45 bar (650 psi)
- **High Pressure**: ≥ 45 bar (650 psi)

This aligns with industrial pump classifications where:
- Brackish water RO: 15-30 bar → Low pressure
- Seawater RO: 50-80 bar → High pressure

## Cost Impact

The fix results in significant cost corrections:

| System Type | Pressure | Previous Cost | Corrected Cost | Reduction |
|------------|----------|---------------|----------------|-----------|
| Single-stage | 30 bar | ~$678,000 | ~$45,000 | 93% |
| Two-stage | 30 bar | ~$404,000 | ~$45,000 | 89% |
| Three-stage | 32 bar | ~$302,000 | ~$46,000 | 85% |

## Costing Methodology

- **Low Pressure Pumps**: $889/(L/s) based on volumetric flow rate
- **High Pressure Pumps**: $1,908/kW based on mechanical power

## Testing

The fix has been tested and verified to correctly classify pumps based on their operating pressure. Log messages now show:

```
INFO: Stage 1 pump classified as low_pressure (30.0 bar)
INFO: Added low_pressure costing block to pump1
```

## Future Improvements

Consider adding a configuration option to allow manual override of pump type classification for special cases.
