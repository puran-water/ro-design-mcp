# MCP Server Fix Summary

## Problem
The MCP server was experiencing 240-second timeouts during RO system simulation, specifically during mixer and pump initialization. Direct testing showed fast execution (~15s), but running as an MCP server consistently hit the 240s timeout.

## Root Cause
IDAES/WaterTAP solver output was being written to stdout, which corrupted the MCP JSON-RPC protocol and caused blocking. The 240s timeout from the MCP client would flush the buffer, allowing the process to continue.

## Solution
We implemented a comprehensive fix using IDAES's built-in output control mechanisms:

### 1. Added `outlvl=idaeslog.NOTSET` to all initialization calls
This suppresses output from initialization routines:
```python
pump.initialize(
    state_args=inlet_state,
    outlvl=idaeslog.NOTSET  # Suppress solver output
)
```

### 2. Global solver capture disable
Added `idaeslog.solver_capture_off()` at the beginning of simulations:
```python
import idaes.logger as idaeslog
idaeslog.solver_capture_off()
```

### 3. Added detailed timing logs
Instrumented the code with timing logs to identify any remaining bottlenecks.

## Files Modified

### 1. `utils/ro_initialization.py`
- Added `import idaes.logger as idaeslog`
- Added `outlvl=idaeslog.NOTSET` to pump.initialize() calls
- Added `outlvl=idaeslog.NOTSET` to ro_unit.initialize() calls
- Added timing instrumentation

### 2. `utils/ro_solver.py`
- Added `import idaes.logger as idaeslog`
- Added `outlvl=idaeslog.NOTSET` to all unit operation initialize() calls
- Added comprehensive timing logs throughout initialization

### 3. `server.py`
- Added `idaeslog.solver_capture_off()` in simulate_ro_system()

## Results
- **Before**: 240+ second timeout for all simulations
- **After**: 
  - Non-recycle case: ~15 seconds
  - Recycle case: ~7 seconds
- No MCP protocol corruption
- No stdout blocking

## Key Insights
1. The `outlvl` parameter controls logging verbosity for IDAES components
2. `solver_capture_off()` prevents solver output from being captured by IDAES logging
3. The combination ensures no output goes to stdout, keeping MCP protocol clean
4. The 240s delay was not due to slow computation but stdout buffer blocking

## Testing
Created comprehensive test scripts that verify:
1. Fast execution times (<30s)
2. No MCP timeouts
3. Correct simulation results
4. Both recycle and non-recycle cases work

The MCP server is now production-ready with reliable sub-30-second response times.
