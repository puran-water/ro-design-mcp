# RO Simulation Improvements Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Recovery Mismatch (91.2% vs 95%)
**Problem**: The recycle template wasn't constraining overall system recovery
**Solution**: Added overall recovery constraint in unified template that ensures:
```python
total_permeate_flow == target_overall * fresh_water_flow
```

### 2. Low Pressures (18-20 bar instead of ~30-40 bar)
**Problems**: 
- Recycle template had no pump optimization logic
- Initial pressures too low for high recovery
- No recovery constraints to drive pressure optimization

**Solutions**:
- Added pump optimization with recovery constraints
- Better pressure initialization based on TDS and recovery
- Pressures now optimize to match recovery targets exactly

### 3. Ion-Specific Tracking with Recycle
**Problem**: Recycle template used seawater package (TDS only), not MCAS
**Solution**: Unified template supports MCAS for ion tracking:
- Tracks Na+, Cl-, Ca2+, Mg2+, etc. individually
- Calculates ion accumulation in recycle streams
- Reports ion-specific concentrations in all streams

### 4. Parameter Passing Bug
**Problem**: `feed_salinity_ppm` accessed as global in function
**Solution**: Fixed in unified template - proper parameter usage

## Key Improvements in Unified Template

### 1. Proper Pump Optimization
- Unfixes pump pressures when `optimize_pumps=True`
- Adds stage recovery constraints
- Adds overall system recovery constraint
- Pressures optimize to achieve exact recovery targets

### 2. SD Transport Model
- Uses Solution-Diffusion model that naturally handles driving pressure
- No need for explicit minimum pressure constraints
- Flux equation: `flux = A × ρ × ((P_feed - P_perm) - (π_feed - π_perm))`

### 3. Ion-Specific Support
- Full MCAS integration for multi-component systems
- Tracks individual ion concentrations
- Handles ion-specific rejection rates
- Proper mass balances for recycle systems

### 4. Robust Initialization
- Estimates required pressures based on TDS and recovery
- Accounts for concentrate TDS increase through stages
- Higher initial pressures for high recovery systems

## Expected Results with Improvements

For the test configuration (25:12 array, 95% recovery, 2000 ppm feed):

### Before (Issues)
- Recovery: 91.2% (mismatch)
- Stage 1: 18.6 bar
- Stage 2: 19.7 bar (barely higher)
- No ion tracking

### After (Fixed)
- Recovery: 95.0% (matches target)
- Stage 1: ~25-30 bar (appropriate for ~4000 ppm concentrate)
- Stage 2: ~35-40 bar (appropriate for ~40,000 ppm concentrate)
- Full ion tracking with recycle effects

## Files Changed

1. **Created**: `/notebooks/ro_simulation_unified_template.ipynb`
   - New unified template supporting MCAS + recycle + optimization

2. **Modified**: `/utils/simulate_ro.py`
   - Updated template selection logic to use unified template

3. **Analysis**: Other templates remain for backward compatibility

## Testing Required

Run the simulate_ro_system tool with:
- Configuration from optimize_ro (95% recovery with recycle)
- Ion composition (Na+/Cl-)
- optimize_pumps=True

Verify:
- [ ] Recovery = 95% ± 0.1%
- [ ] Stage 2 pressure > Stage 1 pressure
- [ ] Pressures > 30 bar for final stage
- [ ] Ion concentrations reported
- [ ] No errors or warnings
