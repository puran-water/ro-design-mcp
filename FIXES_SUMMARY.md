# RO Simulation Fixes Summary

## Successfully Fixed: Unbounded Solver Issue ✅

### Problem
Recycle configurations failed with "unbounded" solver status during successive substitution iterations.

### Root Cause
Deactivating the mixer pressure constraint left pump inlet pressure unconstrained, allowing optimizer to exploit "turbine mode" (negative deltaP) to minimize objective infinitely.

### Solution Implemented
1. **Added pump deltaP bounds** (min 2 bar) to prevent turbine mode
2. **Added work_mechanical bounds** (min 0) - pumps cannot generate power
3. **Bounded mixer outlet pressure** [1-50 bar] before deactivating constraint
4. **Added recycle split fraction bounds** [0, 1]

### Result
✅ Recycle configurations now solve successfully in optimizer
✅ Direct test script confirms 1-stage recycle works

## Remaining Issue: Full Simulation Stage 2

The `simulate_ro_system_v2` still fails at Stage 2 initialization due to multiprocessing/initialization issues specific to the full simulation environment.

## Files Modified
- `utils/ro_solver.py` - Added bounds and diagnostic enhancements
- `utils/ro_model_builder_v2.py` - Added split fraction bounds
- `server.py` - Enhanced error logging

## Test Status
- ✅ `optimize_ro_configuration` - All configurations work including recycle
- ✅ `test_recycle_direct.py` - Direct recycle test passes
- ❌ `simulate_ro_system_v2` - Stage 2 initialization issue persists
