# Membrane Parameterization Implementation Summary

## Executive Summary

We have successfully implemented membrane property parameterization for the RO design MCP server. The implementation allows users to specify custom membrane types (seawater, brackish, low-pressure brackish, nanofiltration) or provide custom A and B values.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Created `membrane_defaults.py`

Location: `/utils/membrane_defaults.py`

This module provides:
- Default A (water permeability) and B (salt permeability) values for different membrane types
- Conversion utilities between units
- Validation functions for membrane properties

Key membrane types implemented:
- **Seawater**: A = 1.26 LMH/bar (3.5e-10 m/s/Pa with density factor)
- **Brackish**: A = 3.96 LMH/bar (1.1e-9 m/s/Pa with density factor)  
- **Low-pressure brackish**: A = 6.0 LMH/bar (1.7e-9 m/s/Pa with density factor)
- **Nanofiltration**: A = 12.6 LMH/bar (3.5e-9 m/s/Pa with density factor)

### 2. Modified MCAS Notebook Template

The `ro_simulation_mcas_template.ipynb` was updated to:
- Import membrane defaults
- Accept `membrane_properties` parameter via Papermill
- Apply custom A_comp and B_comp values to the RO model
- Display membrane properties in results

### 3. Key Findings

#### WaterTAP's Flux Equation
WaterTAP's Solution-Diffusion (SD) model includes water density in the flux equation:
```
J_w = A × ρ_w × (ΔP - Δπ)
```
Where ρ_w = 1000 kg/m³

This means:
- The A value in m/s/Pa must be multiplied by 1000 × 3.6e6 to get effective LMH/bar
- Our initial values were correct after accounting for this density factor

#### FBBT Initialization Issues
During testing, we discovered:
1. **MCAS Property Package Issue**: The FBBT (Feasibility-Based Bound Tightening) error occurs specifically with the MCAS property package at `properties_interface[0.0,0.0].eq_pressure_osm_phase[Liq]`
2. **Simple Property Package Works**: The membrane parameterization works correctly with the simple NaCl property package
3. **Not Related to Membrane Values**: The FBBT error persists even with 10x higher permeability values, confirming it's an MCAS initialization issue

## Current Status

### Working Features
✓ Membrane property defaults for all common membrane types
✓ Custom membrane property specification
✓ Integration with simple NaCl property package
✓ Proper unit conversions and validation
✓ Display of membrane properties in results

### Known Issues
⚠ MCAS property package has FBBT initialization errors when used with custom membrane properties
- This appears to be related to how MCAS calculates osmotic pressure at the membrane interface during initialization
- The issue is not with our membrane parameterization implementation

## Usage Example

```python
# Using predefined membrane type
membrane_properties = {
    "membrane_type": "brackish"
}

# Using custom values
membrane_properties = {
    "membrane_type": "custom",
    "A_comp": {"H2O": 1.4e-9},  # 5.0 LMH/bar effective
    "B_comp": {
        "Na_+": 5.0e-8,
        "Cl_-": 7.0e-8,
        "Ca_2+": 1.5e-8,
        "Mg_2+": 1.0e-8,
        "SO4_2-": 3.0e-9,
        "HCO3_-": 8.0e-8
    }
}
```

## Recommendations

1. **For Production Use**: Use the simple NaCl property package with custom membrane properties until the MCAS initialization issue is resolved
2. **Report to WaterTAP**: The MCAS FBBT error should be reported to the WaterTAP development team
3. **Future Enhancement**: Consider implementing a workaround for MCAS initialization, possibly by:
   - Disabling concentration polarization initially
   - Providing better initial bounds for interface properties
   - Using a different initialization strategy for MCAS

## Test Results

All tests pass when using the simple property package:
- ✓ Membrane defaults correctly loaded
- ✓ A values properly converted with density factor
- ✓ B values applied to all ions
- ✓ Operating pressures reasonable for membrane type
- ✓ Results match expected performance

The implementation is ready for use with the simple property package.
